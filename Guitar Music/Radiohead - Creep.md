```song
**Verse 1:**
When you were here be[C]fore,
couldn't look you in the [E]eye. 
You're just like an [F/A]angel,
your skin makes me [Fm]cry. 
You float like a [C]feather,
in a beautiful [E]world 
I wish I was [F/A]special, 
you're so fucking [Fm]special.

**Chorus:**
But I'm a [C]creep, I'm a [E]weirdo.
What the hell am I doing [F/A]here?
I don't be[Fm]long here. 

**Verse 2:**
I don't care if it [C]hurts,
I want to have con[E]trol. 
I want a perfect [F/A]body,
I want a perfect [Fm]soul.
I want you to [C]notice,
when I'm not a[E]round. 
You're so fucking [F/A]special,
I wish I was [Fm]special.

**[Chorus]**

**Middle Eight:**
[C]She's running out the [E]door, 
[F/A]she's running, 
she [Fm]run, run, run, run, [C]run.
[E]---- [F/A]---- [Fm]----

**Verse 3:**
Whatever makes you [C]happy,
whatever you [E]want. 
You're so fucking [F/A]special,
I wish I was [Fm]special,

**Chorus:**
But I'm a [C]creep, I'm a [E]weirdo.
What the hell am I doing [F/A]here?
I don't be[Fm]long here,
I don't be[C]long here.
