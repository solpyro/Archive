**Intro:**
[G/E]---- [G/F#]---- [Em]-- [G/E]-- [G/F#]---- [G]----
[G/E]---- [G/F#]---- [Em]-- [G/E]-- [G/F#]---- [G]----

**Verse 1:**
[G] You can [G/F#]hold her [Em]hand and [G/E]show her [G/F#]how you [G]cry 
Ex[G]plain to [G/F#]her your [Em] weakness so she understands and then [G/E]roll ov[G/F#]er and [G]die
Well [G]you can [G/F#] brave de[Em]cisions before you [G/E]crumble [G/F#]up   in[G]side 
Spend your [G]time [G/F#]asking [Em]everyone else's permission and then [G/E]run a[G/F#]way and [G]hide

**Verse 2:**
[G]You can [G/F#]sit on [Em]chimneys put some [G/E]fire up [G/F#] your [G]ass
No need to [G]know [G/F#]what you're [Em]doing or waiting for but if [G/E]any [G/F#]one [G]should ask?
Tell them [G]I've been [G/F#]licking [Em]coconut skins and [G/E]we've [G/F#]been hang[G]ing out
Tell them [G]God just [G/F#]dropped [Em]by to forgive our sins and re[G/E]lieve [G/F#]us [G]our doubt

**Bridge:**
[G/E]---- [G/F#]---- [Em]-- [G/E]-- [G/F#]---- [G]----
[G/E]---- [G/F#]---- [Em]-- [G/E]-- [G/F#]---- [G]----

**Verse 3:**
[G]You can [G/F#]hold her [Em]eggs But your [G/E]basket [G/F#]has a [G]hole 
You can [G]lie bet[G/F#]ween her [Em]legs And go lookin' for: 
Tell her you're [G]searching [G/F#]for [G]her soul! 
[G]You can [G/F#]wait for [Em]ages and watch your [G/E]compost [G/F#]turn [G]to coal 
But [G]time [G/F#]is con[Em]tagious: Every[G/E]body's [G/F#]getting [G]old. 

**Verse 4:**
[G]You can [G/F#]sit on [Em]chimneys put some [G/E]fire up [G/F#]your [G]ass
No need to [G]know [G/F#]what you're [Em]doing or looking for but if [G/E]any [G/F#]one  [G]should ask?
Tell them [G]I've been [G/F#]cooking [Em]coconut skins and [G/E]we've [G/F#]been hang[G]ing out
Tell them [G]God just [G/F#]dropped [Em]by to forgive our sins and re[G/E]lieve [G/F#]us [G]our doubt

I'm not sure about the G/E chord, but the rest sounds good
