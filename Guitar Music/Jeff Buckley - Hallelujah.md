```song
**Verse 1:**
Well I [C]heard there was a [Am]secret chord,
That [C]David played and it [Am]pleased the Lord,
But [F]you don't really [G]care for music [C]do ya? {g}
Well it [C]goes like this, the [F]forth,the [E]fifth,
The [Am]minor fall, the [F]major lift,
The [G]baffled king com[E]poses Halle[Am]lujah.

**Chorus:**
Halle[F]lujah, Halle[Am]lujah, Halle[F]lujah, Halle[Am]luu[G]uu[C]jah.

**Verse 2:**
Well your [C]faith was strong, but you [Am]needed proof.
You [C]saw her bathing [Am]on the roof,
Her [F]beauty in the [G]moonlight over[C]threw ya. [G]
She [C]tied you to the [F]kitchen [E]chair.
She [Am]broke your throne, and she [F]cut your hair
And [G]from your lips you [E]drew a Halle[Am]lujah.

**[Chorus]**

**Verse 3:**
Well [C]baby, I've been [Am]here before,
I've [C]seen this room and I've [Am]walked this floor,
I [F]used to live [G]alone before I [C]met ya. [G]
I've [C]seen your flag on the [F]marble [E]arch
And [Am]Love is not a [F]victory march,
It's a [G]cold and its a [E]broken Halle[Am]lujah.

**[Chorus]**

**Verse 4:**
Well there [C]was a time when you [Am]let me know
What's [C]really going [Am]on below
But [F]now you never [G]show that to me [C]do ya? [G]
But re[C]member when i [F]moved in [E]you,
And the [Am]Holy Dove was [F]moving too
And [G]every breath we [E]drew was Halle[Am]lujah.

**[Chorus]**

**Verse 5:**
[C]Maybe theres a [Am]God above,
But [C]all I ever [Am]learned from Love
was [F]how to shoot some[G]body who out[C]drew ya. [G]
And it's [C]not a cry that you [F]hear at [E]night
It's [Am]not somebody who's [F]seen the light
It's a [G]cold and its a [E]broken Halle[Am]lujah.

**[Chorus x 2]**
