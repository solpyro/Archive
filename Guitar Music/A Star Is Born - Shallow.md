**Verse 1:**
[Em7] Tell me [D/F#]something [G]girl...
[C] Are you happy in this [G]modern [D]world?
[Em7] Or do [D/F#]you need [G]more?
[C] Is there something else you're [G]searching [D]for?
[Em7]I'm-- [D/F#]fall---[G]in'
[C] In all the good times I [G]find my[D]self longin' [Em7]----- [D/F#]for -- [G]change
[C] And in the bad times I [G]fear my[D]self [Em7]----- [D/F#]----- [G]
[Em7]----- [D/F#]----- [G]

**Verse 2:**
[Em7] Tell me [D/F#]something [G]boy...
[C]Aren't you tired tryin' to [G]fill that [D]void
[Em7] Or do [D/F#]you need [G]more?
[C]Ain't it hard keeping it [G]so hard[D]core
[Em7]I'm-- [D/F#]fall---[G]ing
[C] In all the good times I [G]find my[D]self longin' [Em7]----- [D/F#]for -- [G]change
[C] And in the bad times I [G]fear my[D]self

**Chorus:**
[Am]I'm off the deep end, [D/F#]watch as I dive in
[G]I'll never [D/F#]meet the [Em]ground
[Am]Crash through the surface, [D/F#]where they can't hurt us
We're [G]far from the [D/F#]shallow [Em]now
[Am] In the sha-ha-[D/F#]sha-ha-low
[G]In the [D]sha-ha-sha-la-[Em]la-la-low
[Am] In the sha-ha-[D/F#]sha-ha-ha-low
We're [G]far from the [D]shallow [Em]now

**Bridge:**
[Em]--- [Bm]Wooaa[D]aah
[A]Woaaaa[Em]aaaaaa[Bm]aaaaaa[D]aaaaa[A]aahhhhh

**[Chorus]**
