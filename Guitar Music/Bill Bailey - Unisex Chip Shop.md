```song
[G]---- [Cadd9]---- [G]---- [Cadd9]----

I [G]used to buy my [Cadd9]chips from an op[Dsus4]presive chip shop re[G]geme
The [G]girl who worked there [Cadd9]she seemed happy but I [Dsus4]knew it was not what it [G]seemed

[C]Do you want salt and [D]vinegar?  Is [Em]what they made her say
but in the [C]language of the ghet[D]to that means [G]help i'm a woman in [G]chains

I wanted to [G]free her, 
In my dreams I would [C]see her running [D]naked in the woods round [G]Raynem
If I [C]had some tigers I'd [G]train em 
[G]---- [G]---- [G]---- 
To pro[G]tect her
from the [C]sexual fashism that was [D]lurkin' round the [G]gerkin

[G]I'd lean accross the [Cadd9]counter and we would [G]talk
I [G]carved the name 'Deb[Cadd9]bie' on a little wooden [G]fork

When [C]into the shop came a [D]skinhead gang, they [G]snatched the fork [Em]from my hand
[C]Debbie she [D]looked at me, [Em]to assert my masculinity 
I said "[C]OI!!!!"
They said "[D]What?""
I said "[G]nothing"

**Outro:**
[Cadd9]-- [G]--
