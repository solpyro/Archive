(Capo 2)

```song
**Intro:**
[Cadd9]---- [Am7]---- [Em]---- [D]----
[Cadd9]---- [Am7]---- [Em]---- [D]----

**Verse 1:**
[Cadd9] We [Am7]broke 
[Em]Everything that was right, [D]we both enjoyed a good fight
[Cadd9] And we [Am7]sewed
[Em]All the holes we had to breathe [D]to make the other one leave
[Cadd9] And I [Am7]loved the [Em]way you looked [D]at me
[Cadd9] And I [Am7]miss the [Em]way you made me [D]feel
When we were [Cadd9]alone
When we were [Cadd9]alone

**Chorus:**
And I'll [Am7]shiver like I used [Em]to [D]
And I'll [Am7]leave him just for [Em]you [D]
And I'll [Am7]shiver like I used [Em]to [D]
Just for [Cadd9]you

**Verse 2:**
[Cadd9] And we [Am7]stole
[Em]Every moment we had to [D]make the other one feel bad
[Cadd9] And we [Am7]hoped that
[Em]we could be what we knew, we'd [D]never turn out to be real
[Cadd9] And I [Am7]loved the [Em]way you looked at [D]me
[Cadd9] And I [Am7]miss the [Em]way you made me [D]feel
When we were [Cadd9]alone
When we were [Cadd9]alone

**[Chorus]**

**Bridge:**
[Cadd9] And if we [Am7]turn back time
[Em] Could we [D]learn to live right
[Cadd9] And if we [Am7]turn back time
[Em] Could we [D]learn to live right
[Cadd9] And if we [Am7]turn back time
[Em] Could we [D]learn to live right
[Cadd9] And if we [Am7]turn back time
[Em] Could we [D]learn

**Final Chorus:**
And I'll [Am7]shiver like I used [Em]to [D]
And I'll [Am7]leave him just for [Em]you [D]
And I'll [Am7]shiver like I used [Em]to [D]
Just for [Cadd9]you
Like I used [Cadd9]to
```
