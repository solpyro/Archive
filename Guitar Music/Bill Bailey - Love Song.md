**Verse 1:**
[Am] I was alone my heart was [G]cold it was a stone,
my soul was [F]lonely like a stone - there was no [E]moss.
[Am] And when I danced I danced a[G]lone but then I did not dance
because I [F]was alone.  So I did not [E]dance.
[Am] I shuffled through life in[G]visible to all the happy [F]couples who would mock
me with their [E]merry laughter - "ha-ha-ha".
[Am] The only sound I heard in my [G]lonely silent world was the [F]rusty hammer of my
heart [E]nailing at the hatred in my [Am]soul.

**Bridge:**
[E]-- [G]-- [Am]-- --

**Verse 2:**
But [G]then you [Cmaj7]came,
And my life was turned [Dm]upside [Dmmaj7]down. [Dm7]
You showed me the [G7]beauty of the things that I had never seen.
Like a [C]snowflake that melts on the eyelash of a [Cmaj7]startled deer. [C]
Or the [Dm]painting of a [Dmmaj7]dog that wears a [Dm7]deerstalker and
[G7]Smokes a pipe that [Dm]made you laugh so [Dmmaj7]heartily,
[Dm7]But I had previously [G7]thought was [C]rubbish. [Cmaj7] [C/G]
Or the [Dm]duck that lands so [Dmmaj7]clumsily on a [Dm]frozen pond in winter
But the [G7]intoxicating power of our love transforms this simple act into an
[C]Anthropomorphic drama where Mr. Duck's [Cmaj7]embarrassed and the other ducks are
[C]Laughing ([Cmaj7]quack quack [C/G]quack quack quack).

**Verse 3:**
[E] AND THEN YOU [Am]LEFT! 
*Flamenco Style*
And I have [G]died a thousand [F]deaths and I will die a thousand [E]more!
I [Am]thought you were an [G]angel - you turned [F]out to be a [E]whore!
[Am]And everything has turned to [G]dust! Everything is infected with the [F]plague!
[E] Why did you have to sleep with [Am]Craig?
[G] "Oh he's so sensitive, [F]he's got a tattoo." [E]
Yeah, [F]carving your name with a compass in my forehead was not e[E]nough for you!

**Verse 4:**
[Am] The snow flake on the eye of the deer [G]has turned to
puss that [F]oozes from an open [E]wound.
[F] The deer now blind it stumbles in[E]to a ravine.
[Am] The duck lies shredded in a pan[G]cake,
[F]soaking in the hoisin of your [E]lies.
[Am] The dog has moved from the pipe to [G]60 cigarettes a day,
and [F]coughs away his life in the [Dm]cold neon re[E]search lab of your [Am]betrayal. [G]
Of your be[F]tray[G]a - [Am]al!
