```song
**Verse 1:**
Well I'll [G]put myself through sexual strife 
If [Csus2]it'll save a poor kids life 
I [G]will not look at titties for a [D]year
Well if it [G]stops and Iraqi becoming dead 
I won't [Csus2]spill my seed on a motel bed
I [G]will not look at [D]titties for a [G]year

**Verse 2:**
Well the [G]internet's been my downfall 
I [Csus2]call it Beelzebub's shopping mall
I've [G]been the happiest shopper-[D]er
I've [G]got enough filth under my bed 
To main[Csus2]tain an erection until I'm dead
I [G]will not look at [D]titties for a [G]year

**Verse 3:**
Well the [C]folks in Africa have been waiting 
For [G]us to stop our manipulating 
Spend our porn dollars on international [D]aid
Well if it [G]pays for a pizza to Pakistan 
I'll [Csus2]quit jerking of for Ramadan
I [G]will not look at [D]titties 
Well [G/B]maybe for a couple of [Csus2]months
I [G]will not look at [D]titties for a [G]year
