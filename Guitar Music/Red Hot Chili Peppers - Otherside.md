```song
**Intro:**
[Am]---- [F]---- [C]---- [G]----

**Chorus:**
[Am] How long, [F] how long will I [C]slide?
[G]Separate my [Am]side [F]
[C]I don't, [G]don't believe it's [Am] bad [F]
[C]Slittin' my throat it's [G]all I ever

**Verse 1:**
[Am]I heard your voice through [Em]a photograph
[Am]I thought it up and brought [Em]up the past
[Am]Once you know you can never [Em]go back
[G]I've got to take it on the [A]otherside

**Verse 2:**
[Am] Centuries are what it [Em]meant to me
[Am]A cemetery where I [Em]marry the sea
[Am]Stranger things never [Em]change my mind
I've got to [G]take it on the [A]otherside
[G]Take it on the [A]otherside
[G]Take it on
[A]Take it on

**[Chorus]**

**Verse 3:**
[Am]Pour my life into a [Em]paper cup
[Am]The ashtray's full and I'm [Em]spillin' my guts
[Am]She wants to know am I [Em]still a slut
I've got to [G]take it on the [A]otherside

**Verse 4:**
[Am]Scarlet starlet and she's [Em]in my bed
[Am]A candidate for my [Em]soul mate bled
[Am]Push the trigger and [Em]pull the thread
I've got to [G]take it on [A]the otherside
[G]Take it on [A]the otherside
[G]Take it on
[A]Take it on

**[Chorus]**

**Instrumental:**
[Em]---- [C]---- [Em]---- [C]----

**Bridge:**
[Em]Turn me on take me for a hard ride
[C]Burn me out leave me on the otherside
[Em]I yell and tell it that
It's not my friend
[C]I tear it down I tear it down
And then it's born again

**Instrumental:**
[Am]---- [F]---- [C]---- [G]----

**[Chorus x2]**
[Am]had.
```
