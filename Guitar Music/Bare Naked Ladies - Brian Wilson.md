```song
**Verse 1:**
[G] Drove [D]downtown in the [Am7]rain, 9:30 on a Tuesday [G]night
Just to [D]check out the late night [Bm7]record [Am7]shop
[G]Call it im[D]pulsive, call it com[Am7]pulsive, call it insane
[G]But when I'm sur[D]rounded I just can't [Bm7]stah-[Am7]op

**Verse 2:**
[G] It's a matter of [D]instinct, it's a matter of con[A7]ditioning, a matter of fact [G]
You can [D]call me Pavlov's [Bm7]do__[Am7]og
[G] Ring a [D]bell and I'll salivate, [Am7]well how'd you like that 
[G] Dr. [D]Landy tell me you're [Bm7]not just a [Am7]pedagogue, 'cause right now I'm

**Chorus:**
[G] Lying in [D]bed just like [Am7]Brian Wilson did
Well I'm, [G] lying in [D]bed just like Brian [Em]Wilson did [Em/C]- [Em/C#]- [Em/C]-- [Em]--

**Verse 3:**
[G] Well I'm [D[lying here, [Am7] just staring at the ceiling [G]tiles
And I'm [D]thinking about, [Bm7]whoa what to think a[Am7]bout
[G] Just [D]listening and re[Am7]listening to smiley [G]smile
And I'm [D]wondering if this is [Bm7]some kind of cre[Am7]ative doubt, because I'm

**[Chorus]**

**Bridge:**
[Am7]And if you wanna [D]find me I'll be [F] out in the [Em]sandbox
[Am7]Just wondering [D]where the hell all the [G]love has [F]gah-ah-[Am7]ahn
Playing my gui[D]tar and building [F]castles in the [Em]sun, whoa-whoa-[Am7]oh-oh
And [D]singing fun, fun, [G]fun

**[Chorus]**

[Am] I [E7]had a [Am]dream that I was [E7]three hundred [Am]pounds
And [E7]though I was very [Am]heavy I [E7]floated 'til I couldn't see the [Am]ground
*(Pick up the rythym at this point)*
I [E7]floated 'til I [Am]couldn't see the [E7]ground
[Am]Somebody help me ([E7]I couldn't see the ground)
[Am]Somebody help me ([E7]I couldn't see the ground)
[Am]Somebody help meee[E7]eee, because I'm

**[Chorus]**

[G] Drove [D]downtown in the ray-ee-[Am7]ain, 9:30 on a Tuesday [G]night
Just to [D]check out the late night [Bm7]record [Am7]shop (late night record [G]shop)
Call it im[D]pulsive, call it com[Am7]pulsive, or call it insane (whoa-oh)
[G] 'Cause when I'm sur[D]rounded I just can't [Bm7]stah-ah-ah-[Cmaj7]p

[Em]----- [Em/C]- [Em/C#]-- [Em/C]--
[Em]----- [Em/C]- [Em/C#]-- [Em/C]--
[Em]----
