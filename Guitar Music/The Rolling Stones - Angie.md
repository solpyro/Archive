```song
[Am]Angie, [E7]Angie, [G]when will those [F]clouds all disap[C]pear? 
[Am]Angie, [E7]Angie, [G]where will it [F]lead us from [C]here? 
With no [G]loving in our souls and no [Dm]money in our [Am]coats 
[C]You can't [F]say we're satis[G]fied 
But [Am]Angie, [E7]Angie, [G]you can't [F]say we never [C]tried 

[Am]Angie, you're [E7]beautiful, [G]but ain't it [F]time we said good-[C]bye? 
[Am]Angie, I still [E7]love you, [G]remember [F]all those nights we [C]cried? 
All the [G]dreams we held so close seemed to [Dm]all go up in [Am]smoke 
[C]Let me [F]whisper in your [G]ear: 
[Am]Angie, [E7]Angie, [G]where will it [F]lead us from [C]here? 

[Am]---- [E7]---- [G]-- [F]-- [C]----
[Am]---- [E7]---- [G]-- [F]-- [C]----

Oh, [G]Angie, don't you weep, all your [Dm]kisses still taste [Am]sweet 
[C]I hate that [F]sadness in your [G]eyes 
But [Am]Angie, [E7]Angie, [G]ain't it [F]time we said good-[C]bye? 
 
[Am]---- [E7]---- [G]-- [F]-- [C]----
 
With no [G]loving in our souls and no [Dm]money in our [Am]coats 
[C]You can't [F]say we're satis[G]fied 
 
But [Dm]Angie, I still love you, [Am]baby 
[Dm]Ev'rywhere I look I see your [Am]eyes 
[Dm]There ain't a woman that comes [Am]close to you 
[C]Come on [F]Baby, dry your [G]eyes 
But [Am]Angie, [E7]Angie, [G]ain't it [F]good to be a[C]live? 
[Am]Angie, [E7]Angie, [G]they can't [F]say we never [C]tried [Dm]---- [C]----
