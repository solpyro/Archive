**Intro:**
[Bm7]---- [Bm7]---- [Bm7]---- [Bm7]----
[Bm7]---- [Bm7]---- [Bm7]---- [Bm7]----

**Verse 1:**
You'll re[Bsus2]member me when the [G]west wind moves
Upon the fields of [D]barley
You'll for[Bsus2]get the sun in his [G]jealous [D]sky
As we [G/B]walk in the [A]fields of [D]gold.
She [Bsus2]took her love for to [G]gaze a while
Upon the fields of [D]barley
In his [Bsus2]arms she fell as her [G]hair came [D]down
A[G/B]mong the [A]fields of [D]gold.

**Verse 2:**
Will you [Bsus2]stay with me, will you [G]be my love
Among the fields of [D[barley?
We'll for[Bsus2]get the sun in his [G]jealous [D]sky
As we [G/B]lie in [A]fields of [D]gold.
See the [Bsus2]west wind move like a [G]lover so,
Upon the fields of bar[D]ley.
Feel her [Bsus2]body rise when you [G]kiss her [D]mouth,
A[G/B]mong the [A]fields of [D]gold.

**Middle:**
[G]I never made [D]promises lightly
[G]And there have been [D]some that i've broken
[G]But I swear in the [D]days still left
We'll [G/B]walk in [A]fields of [D]gold,
We'll [G/B]walk in [A]fields of [D]gold.

**Instrumental:**
[Bsus2]---- [G]---- [G]---- [D]----
[Bsus2]---- [G]-- [D]-- [G/B]-- [A]-- [D]----

**Verse 3:**
Many [Bsus2]years passed since those [G]summer days
Among the fields of [D]barley
see the [Bsus2]children run as the [G]sun goes [D]down
A[G/B]mong the [A]fields of [D]gold.
You'll re[Bsus2]member me when the [G]west wind moves 
Upon the fields of [D]barley
You can [Bsus2]tell the sun in his [G]jealous [D]sky
When we [G/B]walked in the [A]fields of [D]gold,
When we [G/B]walked in the [A]fields of [D]gold,
When we [G/B]walked in the [A]fields of [D]gold.
