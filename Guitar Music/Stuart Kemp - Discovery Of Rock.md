**Verse 1:**
[C]Why do I [G]feel alone
[D]In a world of [Em]friends?
[C]What am I [G]yearing for?
[D]Why do I pre[Em]tend?

**Chorus:**
[G]I can see a [D]saivour who will
[A]Never let us [Em]down.
[G]He is always [D]there for us,
[A]To save us when [Em]we drown.

**Verse 2:**
[C]There is some[G]thing in this world
Thats [D]slightly out [Em]of key.
"[C]Open Your [G]hearts", he said,
"And [D]listen to [Em]me."

**[Chorus]**	
[C]So we stand to[G]gether now
And [D]Wait for his [Em]return.
[C]The true Lord [G]of Heaven and Earth.
[D]God, the Holy [Em]one.

**End Chorus:**
[G]I can see a [D]saivour who will
[A]Never let us [Em]down.
[G]He is always [D]there for us,
[A]To save us when [C2]we drown...
We [Em]drown.
