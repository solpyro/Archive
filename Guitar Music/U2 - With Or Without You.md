```song
**Intro:**
[G]---- [D]---- [Em]---- [C]----
[G]---- [D]---- [Em]---- [C]----

**Verse 1:**
[G] See the [D]stone set in your [Em]eyes         
See the [C]thorn twist in your [G]side
And I'll [D]wait for [Em]you [C]
[G] Sleight of [D]hand and twist of [Em]fate
On a bed of [C]nails, she makes me [G]wait
And I'll [D]wait, with[Em]out you [C]
With or with[G]out you, [D] with or with[Em]out you [C]

**Verse 2:**
[G] Through the [D]storm we reach the [Em]shore
You give it [C]all but I want [G]more
And I'm [D]waiting [Em]for you [C]

**Chorus:**
With or with[G]out you, [D] with or [Em]without you I [C]
I can't [G]live [D] with or with[Em]out you [C]

**Bridge:**
And you [G]give yourself a[D]way,
and you [Em]give yourself a[C]way
And you [G]give, And you [D]give,
And you [Em]give yourself a[C]way

**Interlude:**
[G]---- [D]---- [Em]---- [C]----

**Verse 3:**
[G] My hands are [D]tied, 
[Em] my body [C]bruised, she's got me [G]with
nothing to [D]win, and [Em]nothing left to [C]lose

**[Bridge]**

**[Chorus]**
[G]----
