**Intro:**
[G]---- [Cadd9]---- [G]----

**Verse 1:**
[G]The horse, Is a [Cadd9]noble Beast,
From the [D]mustang from the west,
To the [Cadd9]Stallion to the [G]east.
But the [Cadd9]horse has a distant [G]cousin,
It [Cadd9]lives i do not know [G]where,
But its [Cadd9]message of racial [G]harmony,
Is [Em/Em7]one that we all can [G]share.

**Chorus 1:**
Hats off to the [G]zebra,
He is [Cadd9]black and [G]white,
[Cadd9]He doesnt [G]fight because there [Em/Em7]not very good at [D]it.

In a [Cadd9]world of con[G]fusion,
We [Cadd9]all need a [G]sign
If [Cadd9]only we could live [G]side by side,
like the [Em/Em7]stripes on a zebras [D]spine.
Hat's off to the [G]Zebras,

**Verse 2:**
The [G]humble badger,
Takes a [Cadd9]sip of mornin' dew
But [D]he's totally colour blind,
So [Cadd9]he cant judge [G]you.
But the [Cadd9]badger is a [G]dreamer
The [Cadd9]badger has a [G]plan
He [Cadd9]knows that his [G]destiny is to [Em/Em7]help his fellow [D]man.

**Chorus 2:**
Hats of to the [G]badgers,
They are [Cadd9]black and [G]white
and [Cadd9]they dont [G]fight,
except for [Em/Em7]mating rights and [D]territory.

[Cadd9]Black man and a white [G]man,
[Cadd9]Both they need to [G]shave,
[Cadd9]United by the [G]badger brush
Hes [Em/Em7]helping from beyond the [D]grave.
Hats off to the [G]badger

What about the [Cadd9]tapir [G]
half [Cadd9]zebra half [G]pig-a
i[Cadd9]magine the [G]stig-ma
but the [Cadd9]tapir stands [G]proud
hats off to the [Cadd9]tapir. [G]

[Cadd9]Badgers and [G]zebras,
[Cadd9]Skunks.. Oh [G]yeah,
And [Cadd9]ring tailed [G]lemurs
[Cadd9]Living to[G]gether
In [Em/Em7]harmony
And if the.. [D]Killer whales can do it,
why cant we. [G]---- [Cadd9]---- [G]----
```
