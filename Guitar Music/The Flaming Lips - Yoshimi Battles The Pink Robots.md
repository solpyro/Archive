**Intro:**
[C]---- [Em]---- [Dm]---- [F]-- [G]--
[C]---- [Em]---- [Dm]---- [F]-- [G]--

**Verse 1:**
[C] Her name is Yo[Em]shimi, [F] she's a black belt in ka[G]rate
[C] Working for the [Em]city, [F] she has to discipline her [G]body
Cause she [Fmaj7]knows that it's de[G]manding to de[C]feat those [C/B]evil [F]machines
[Fmaj7] I know she can [G]beat them

**Chorus 1:**
Oh Yo[C]shimi, they don't be[Em]lieve me, but [Dm]you won't let those [F]robots [G]eat me
Yo[C]shimi, they don't be[Em]lieve me, but [Dm]you won't let those [F]robots de[G]feat me

**Verse 2:**
[C] Those evil natured [Em]robots, [F] they're programmed to de[G]stroy us 
[C] She's gotta be strong to [Em]fight them, [F] so she's taking lots of [G]vitamins 
Cause she [Fmaj7]knows that it'd be [G]tragic if those [C]evil ro[C/B]bots [F]win 
[Fmaj7] I know she can [G]beat them

**Chorus 2:**
Oh Yo[C]shimi, they don't be[Em]lieve me, but [Dm]you won't let those [F]robots de[G]feat me
Yo[C]shimi, they don't be[Em]lieve me, but [Dm]you won't let those [F]robots [G]eat me,

Yo[C]shimi [Em]---- [Dm]---- [F]-- [G]--
[C]---- [Em]---- [Dm]---- [F]-- [G]--

**Chorus 3:**
Cause she [Fmaj7]knows that it'd be [G]tragic if those [C]evil ro[C/B]bots [F]win 
[Fmaj7] I know she can [G]beat them
Oh Yo[C]shimi, they don't be[Em]lieve me, but [Dm]you won't let those [F]robots de[G]feat me,
Oh Yo[C]shimi, they don't be[Em]lieve me, but [Dm]you won't let those [F]robots de[G]feat me,
Yo[C]shimi, they don't be[Em]lieve me, but [Dm]you won't let those [F]robots [G]eat me,
Yo[C]shimi, they don't be[Em]lieve me, but [Dm]you won't let those [F]robots [G]eat me,
Yo[C]shimi [Em]---- [Dm]---- [F]-- [G]--
