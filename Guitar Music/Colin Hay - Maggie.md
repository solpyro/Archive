**Intro:**
[Em]---- [D]---- [Em]---- [C]-- [Am7]-- 
[Am]---- [Em]---- [G]---- [D]----

**Verse 1:**
[Em] When I [D]first set eyes on [Em]you [C]-- [Am7]-- [Am]----
First you [Em]beat me up, [G]then you kissed me [D]too
[Em] We'd throw [D]stones into the [Em]sea [C]-- [Am7]-- [Am]----
There were no [Em]others there, [G]just you and [D]me
[Em] I crossed the [D]bridge and down the [Em]lane [C]-- [Am7]-- [Am]----
I knew I [Em]loved you then, you [G]said you did the [D]same

**Chorus 1:**
[Am] Oh [G]Maggie, [Am] what have you [G]done?
[Am] I should've seen it [G]coming, and to your side I'd [D]run
[Am] Oh [G]Maggie, [Am]come to me to[G]night
[Am] I will wait [G]up for you, make sure you're al[D]right
[Em]I miss [D]you [Em]---- [C]-- [Am7]-- 
[Am]---- [Em]---- [G]---- [D]----

**Verse 2:**
[Em] You taught me [D]how to sink or [Em]swim [C]-- [Am7]-- [Am]----
When I was [Em]scared that day, [G]you just pushed me [D]in
[Em] And when no[D]body was a[Em]round [C]-- [Am7]-- [Am]----
You let me [Em]kiss you then, and [G]there the love I [D]found
[Em] I said I'd [D]never let you [Em]go [C]-- [Am7]-- [Am]----
You just [Em]smiled at me, [G]how was I to [D]know

**Chorus 2:**
[Am] Oh [G]Maggie, [Am] what am I to [G]do?
[Am] How can I [G]live with only memories of [D]you
[Am] Oh [G]Maggie, [Am]tell me the [G]truth
[Am] When your ship was [G]sinking, did you think it [D]through
[Em]I miss [D]you [Em]---- [C]-- [Am7]-- 
[Am]---- [Em]---- [G]---- [D]----

**Verse 3:**
[Em] You were the [D]fountain of my [Em]youth [C]-- [Am7]-- [Am]----
And when I [Em]fumbled you [G]showed me what to [D]do
[Em] And when we [D]were both seven[Em]teen [C]-- [Am7]-- [Am]----
You left me [Em]standing there but [G]you were never [D]mean
[Em] And when I [D]saw you out with [Em]him [C]-- [Am7]-- [Am]----
He looked much [Em]older and [G]you looked very [D]thin
[Em] I hadn't [D]heard from you in [Em]years [C]-- [Am7]-- [Am]----
And then your [Em]mama called, she [G]couldn't speak for [D]tears
[Em] She said you [D]left me a [Em]note [C]-- [Am7]-- [Am]----
Inside my [Em]pocket burns [G]with these words you [D]wrote

**Chorus 3:**
[Am] Hey [G]darling boy, [Am]don't you cry for [G]me
[Am] I am [G]forever yours now that I am [D]free
[Am] We'll be [G]together, throw [Am]stones into the [G]sea
[Am] There'll be no [G]others there just you and [D]me
[Em]I miss [D]you, [Em]---- [C]Mag[Am7]gie's 
[Am]gone [Em]---- [G]---- [D]----

**Verse 4:**
Em           D              Em    C Am7 Am
[Em] I think you [D]came the other [Em]night [C]-- [Am7]-- [Am]----
               Em         G                 D
You stroked my [Em]brow, your [G]eyes were full of [D]light
Em           D           Em    C Am7 Am
[Em] It may have [D]only been a [Em]dream [C]-- [Am7]-- [Am]----
           Em               G        D          Em
But I will [Em]walk with you to [G]places I [D]never have 
[Em]been [D]---- [Em]---- [C]Mag[Am7]gie's 
[Am]gone [Em]---- [G]---- [D]----
[Em]----
