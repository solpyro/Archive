```song
[A]---- [C#m]---- [Cm]- [Bm]--- [Dm]-- [C#m]-- *x2*

**Verse:**
[A] Together on the [C#m]sand
we [Cm]walked [Bm]hand in hand [Dm]
[C#m]On the beach[A]front, she smiled at [C#m]me
As she tight[Cm]ly [Bm]held my hand
[Dm] I had my [C#m]finger up her...
[A] Country music played [C#m]on the radio
So [Cm]I  [Bm]turned it off [Dm]
we walked [C#m]down to the [A]water
as she [C#m]grabbed on to my [Cm]- [Bm]honker
[D] A wave [C#m]swept us [A]away [C#m]

**Outro:**
ahh [Cm]ah [Bm]ah... [C#m]
ahh [Cm]ah [Bm]ah... [C#m]
woah [Cm]woah [Bm]woah... [C#m]
```
