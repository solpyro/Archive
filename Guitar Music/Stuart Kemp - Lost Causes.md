[Fmaj7]---- [Am]---- [Dm]---- [Dm]----
[Fmaj7]---- [Am]---- [Dm]---- [Dm]----
[Fmaj7]---- [C]---- [G]---- [G]----

**Verse 1:**
[Fmaj7] I looked across the room,
[C] You stood across the room.
[G] Nothing's easy!
[Fmaj7] I turned around to see
[C] He's standing, watching me.
[G] Jelousy!

**Chorus:**
[Dm] Why can't I see?
[Am] Why does it have to be?
[Dm] I can't live without [Am]you! *x2*

**Verse 2:**
[Fmaj7] I walked across the room,
[C] You stood there with the groom.
[G] You saw me.
[Fmaj7] I produced the knife,
[C] Took his [G]life.

**[Chorus]**

**Verse 3:**
[Fmaj7] Walking away,
[C] I feel the devil play
[G] for my soul.
[Fmaj7] The world is blank.
[C] Slipping away,
Slipping a[G]way!
[Fmaj7] Nothing to do,
[C] Nothing to lose,
[G] I choose you!

**[Chorus]**

**Outro:**
