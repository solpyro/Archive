## Tools & Notes
[Oolimo Chord Analyzer](https://www.oolimo.com/en/guitar-chords/analyze) for figuring out the names for chords.

[TabDown](https://github.com/ultimate-guitar/Tabdown) looks much nicer than [Markdown Chords](https://github.com/dnotes/obsidian-markdown-chords), in that the markdown files look the same with or without rendering (chord formations aside) but the repo is 7 years old, inactive and no-one's turned it into an Obsidian plugin.
