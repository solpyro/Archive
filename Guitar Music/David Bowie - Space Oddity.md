**Intro:**
[C]---- [Em]----

[C]Ground control to Major [Em]Tom
[C]Ground control to Major [Em]Tom
[Am]Take your [Am7]protein pills and [D7]put your helmet on

[C]Ground control to Major [Em]Tom
[C]Commencing countdown, engines [Em]on
[Am]Check [Am7]ignition and may [D7]Gods love be with you
 
[C]This is ground control to Major [E7]Tom
You’ve really made the [F]grade
And the [Fm]papers want to [C]know whose shirts you [F]wear
Now its [Fm]time to leave the [C]capsule if you [F]dare

[C]This is Major Tom to ground con[E7]trol
I’m stepping through the [F]door
And I’m [Fm]floating in a [C]most peculiar [F]way
And the [Fm]stars look very [C]different to[F]day

For [Fmaj7]here
Am I [Em]sitting in a tin can
[Fmaj7]Far above the [Em]world
[Bb]Planet earth is [Am]blue
And there’s [G]nothing I can [F]do
 
[C]---- [F]---- [G]---- [A]---- [A]---- *x2*
[Fmaj7]---- [Em]---- [A]---- [C]---- [D]---- [E]----
 
[C]Though I’m past one hundred thousand [E7]miles
I’m feeling very [F]still
And I [Fm]think my spaceship [C]knows which way to [F]go
Tell me [Fm]wife I love her [C]very much she [F]knows
 
[G]Ground control to [E7]Major Tom
Your [Am]circuits dead, there’s [Am7]something wrong
Can you [D7]hear me, Major Tom? 
Can you [C]hear me, Major Tom? 
Can you [G]hear me, Major Tom?  
Can you....
 

For [Fmaj7]here
Am I [Em]sitting in a tin can
[Fmaj7]Far above the [Em]moon
[Bb]Planet earth is [Am]blue
And there’s [G]nothing I can [F]do
 
[C]---- [F]---- [G]---- [A]---- [A]---- *x2*
[Fmaj7]---- [Em]---- [A]---- [C]---- [D]---- [E]----
