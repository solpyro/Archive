**Intro:**
[C1]My life is brilliant. [G]---- [Am7]---- [Fadd9]----
[C1]---- [G]---- [Am7]---- [Fadd9]----
[C1]---- [G]---- [Am7]---- [Fadd9]----

**Verse 1:**
[C1]My life is brilliant.
[G]My love is pure.
[Am7]I saw an angel.
[Fadd9]Of that I'm sure.
[C1]She smiled at me on the subway.
[G]She was with another man.
[Am7]But I won't lose no sleep on that,
[Fadd9]'Cause I've got a plan.

**Chorus:**
[F] You're beauti[G]ful. [C]You're beautiful.
[F] You're beauti[G]ful, it's [C]true.
I [F]saw your [G]face in a [C]crow[G]ded [Am]place,
And I [F]don't know [G]what to [Am]do,
'Cause I'll [F]never [G]be with [C1]you. [G]---- [Am7]---- [Fadd9]----

**Verse 2:**
Yes, she [C1]caught my eye,
As we [G]walked on by.
She could [Am7]see from my face that I was,
[Fadd9] flying high,
And [C1]I don't think that I'll [G]see her again,
But we [Am7]shared a moment that will [Fadd9]last till the end.

**[Chorus]**

**Bridge:**
[F] Na na [Am]na na na 
[F] Na na [Am]na na na
[F] Na na [Am]na na na [G]Na

**Final Chorus:**
[F] You're beauti[G]ful. [C]You're beautiful.
[F] You're beauti[G]ful, it's [C]true.
[F]There must be an [G]angel with a [C]smile on [G]her [Am]face,
[Am]When she [C]thought up that I [Am]should be with you.
[Am]But it's time to [G]face the [Am7]truth,
I will [Fadd9]never [G]be with [C1]you
```
