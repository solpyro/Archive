[E]Beautiful ladies in danger,
[F#]Danger all around the world.
[A]I will protect them,
Because [B]I am Chris De Burg.

[E]Beautiful [D]Ladies
In [A]Emergency [E]Situations.

[E]Beautiful ladies are lovely,
But [F#]sometimes they don't take care.
They're [A]too busy with their make-up,
Or [B]combing their lovely hair,
To take [E]basic [D]safety [A]precautions.

But I will pro[E]tect them!
I will save the [F#]pretty ones with their smiles and their sparkaling [A]eyes,
But [E]let the [D]ugly ones [A]die...

I have no [E]place for them, in my new world [A]order.
I won't [E]waste my [D]seed on [A]hideous [E]trolls.

[F#]Kill, kill, kill, kill, [A]kill the trolls!
[E]Hunt them down, there shall [B]be no clemency!
[F#]Kill, kill, kill, kill, [A]kill the trolls!
Look [E]under the [D]bridges, [A]that's where they [E]hide. (thats where they hide)

And [E]beauty [D] shall [A]be my [E]bride.
