**Intro:**
[Dm]---- [Dm]----

**Verse 1:**
[Dm]We're Walking in the air 
We're [Dm]floating in the moonlit [C]sky
The [Gm]people far below are [B]sleeping as we fly [Dm]
I'm [Dm]holding very tight 
I'm [Dm]riding in the midnight [C]blue
I'm [Gm]finding I can fly so [B]high above with you [Dm]

[F]---- [Dm]---- [B]---- [Gm]---- [Dm]---- [Dm]----

[Dm]On across the world 
The [Dm]villages go by like [C]dreams
The [Gm]rivers and the hills, the [B]forests and the streams [Dm]

[A]Children gaze [Dm]open mouthed [G]taken by sur[C]prise
[Cm]Nobody [F]down below be[B]lieves their [A]eyes

We're [Dm]surfing in the air 
We're [Dm]swimming in the frozen [C]sky
We're [Gm]drifting over ice and [B]mountains floating by [Dm]

[F]---- [Dm]---- [B]---- [Gm]---- [Dm]---- [Dm]----

[A]Suddenly [Dm]swooping low [G]on an ocean [C]deep
[Cm]Rousing up [F]mighty monster [B]from his [A]sleep

We're [Dm]walking in the air 
We're [Dm]dancing in the midnight [C]sky
And [Gm]everyone who sees us [B]greet us as we fly [Dm]
```
