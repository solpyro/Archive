**Intro:**
**[Riff 1 x5]**
[G]---- [G]----
**[Riff 1 x4]**
[G]---- [G]----

**Verse 1:**
[C] So, so you think you can [D]tell
Heaven from [Am]hell, blue skies from [G]pain?
Can you tell a green [D]field from a cold steel [C]rail,
A smile from a [Am]veil? Do you think you can [G]tell

**Verse 2:**
And did they get you to [C]trade your heroes for [D]ghosts?
Hot ashes for [Am]trees? Hot air for a cool [G]breeze?
Cold comfort for [D]change? Did you ex[C]change
A walk on part in the [Am]war for a lead roll in a [G]cage?

**[Riff 1 x4]**
[G]---- [G]----

**Verse 3:**
[C] How I wish, how I wish you were [D]here.
Cause we're just [Am]two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl
[G] Year after year.
[D] Running over the same old ground [C]but have we found
The same old [Am]fears? Wish you were [G]here.

**[Riff 1 x4]**
[G]---- [G]---- [G]----
**[Riff 1 till end]**
