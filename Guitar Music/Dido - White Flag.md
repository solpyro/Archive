**Intro**

C | Em | C | Em |
```

```song
**Verse 1:**
[Am]I know you think that I shouldn't still love you
I'll [Em]tell you that
but if [Am]I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it
[Em]where's the sense in that?
I promise [G]I'm not trying to make your life harder
or re[Dm]turn to where we were [Em]
 
**Chorus:**
[F] but I will go down with this [C] ship
and I won't [Dm]put my hands up and surr[Am]ender
there will be [F]no white flag above my [C] door
I'm in [G]love and always [Dm] will be
 
**Verse 2:**
[Am]I know I left too much mess
and destruction to come [Em]back again
and I cause [Am]nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't [Em]talk to me again
[G] and if you live by the rules of it's over
then I'm [Dm]sure that that makes sense [Em]
 
**[Chorus]** 
 
**Bridge:** 
and when we [C]meet, which I'm sure we will
all that was [Em]then, will be there still
I'll let it [Dm]pass, and hold my tongue
and you will [G]think that I've moved on
 
**[Chorus x2]**
```
