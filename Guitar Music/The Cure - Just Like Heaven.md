```song
**Verse 1:**
"[A]Show me how you [E]do that trick
The [Bmone that makes me [D]scream" she said
"The [A]one that makes me [E]laugh" she said
And [Bm]threw her arms a[D]round my neck
"[A]Show me how you [E]do it
And I [Bm]promise you I [D]promise that
I'll run a[A]way with you [E]
I'll run a[Bm]way with you" [D]

[A]---- [E]---- [Bm]---- [D]----
[A]---- [E]---- [Bm]---- [D]----

**Verse 2:**
[A]Spinning on that [E]dizzy edge
I [Bm]kissed her face and [D]kissed her head
And [A]dreamed of all the [E]different ways
I [Bm]had to make her [D]glow.
"[A]Why are you so [E]far away?" she [Bm]said
"Oh won't you [D]ever know that I'm in [A]love with you [E]
That I'm in [Bm]love with you" [D]

**Chorus:**
[F#m]You, [G]Soft and only
[F#m]You, [G]Lost and lonely
[F#m]You, [G]Strange as angels
[D]Dancing in the deepest oceans
[E]Twisting in the water

You're just like a dream

[A]---- [E]---- [Bm]---- [D]----
[A]---- [E]---- [Bm]---- [D]----

**Verse 3:**
[A]Daylight licked me [E]into shape
I [Bm]must have been a[D]sleep for days
And [A]moving lips to [E]breathe her name
I [Bm]opened up my [D]eyes.
And [A]found myself a[E]lone alone
A[Bmlone above a [D]raging sea
That [A]stole the only [E]girl I loved
And [Bm]drowned her deep in[D]side of me

**Chorus 2:**
[F#m]You, [G]Soft and only
[F#m]You, [G]Lost and lonely
[F#m]You, [G]Just like heaven [D]
```
