**Intro:**
C                       C
[C]Jayne The man they call [C]Jayne

**Chorus:**
He [C] robbed from the rich
and he [Am] gave to the poor
Stood [C]up to the man
and he [Am]gave him what for
Our [F]love for him now
ain't [G]hard to explain
The [C]hero of Canton
the [G]man they call [C]Jayne [C/B] [Am]

**Verse 1:**
Now [Am]Jayne saw the [E7]mudders' backs [Am]breakin'
He [Dm]saw the [E7]mudders' [Am]lament
And he [Am]saw the [E7]Magistrate [Am]takin'
every [Dm]dollar and [E7]leavin' five [Am]cents
so he said "[Dm]You can't do that to my [Am]people"
he said "[Dm]can't crush them under your [E7]heel"
Jayne [Am]strapped on his [E7]hat
and in [Am]5 seconds [Dm]flat
stole [Am]everything Boss [E7]Higgins had to [Am]steal

**[Chorus]**

**Verse 2:**
Now [Am]here is what [E7]separates [Am]heroes
From [Dm]common folk like [E7]you and [Am]I
The [Am]man they call [E7]Jayne
He [Am]turned 'round his [Dm]plane
And [Am]let that [Em]money hit [Am]sky
He [Dm]dropped it onto our [Am]houses
He [Dm]dropped it into our [E7]yards
The [Am]man they call [E7]Jayne
He [Am]stole away our [Dm]pain
And [Am]headed [E7]out for the [Am]stars

**[Chorus]**
```
