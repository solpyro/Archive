The game will consist of two distinct sections: [[Daytime]] & [[Dreamtime]].

During Daytime, the player will have a series of mysteries to solve through a 3D 3rd person adventure (a blend of sandbox and point-and-click).

Dreamtime will put the player in a similar world (in layout, and eventually aesthetics), only this one will be filled with strange monsters.
>**Pete:** Like demons? Or sort of half people all corrupted (Shuffling Teddy Boys etc... that look like monsters but are still sort of human)

>**Pete:** So the game is clearly segmented into shooting and puzzle solving? (At least to start off with.) Might it be better to merge the two a bit more so it doesn't seem a bit too episodic? 
>**Stu:** Yea, I can see some of the puzzles during the day involving a bit of violence. I don't think I've seen a single Noir where the hero doesn't get beaten up at least once :P but there shouldn't be any call for puzzles at night time. Also, the concept is quite episodic anyway, as the two worlds should look really different to begin with. 
>**Pete:** Yeh sounds good. How would we time things? A night-time episode after every short section? Cos i guess if the individual ones are sort of optional (save the main missions) would the amount of night-time ones be planned out? Or are they totally random?

To begin with the dreamscape should be very different from the real city, but as the Daytime mysteries become darker, the landscape and monsters should become more like the city and citizens.

The idea is to create a reality the player where the city and citizens at day need the PI's help, while the Dreamtime is simply the player-characters dreams.

As the Dreamtime begins to resemble the Daytime, the mysteries of the Daytime should become more influenced by te player's actions during Dreamtime. Ultimately, the player should realise that Dreamtime is a twisted perception of the city at night, and the players actions there have real consequences. 
>**Pete:** Hiding this could be hard. 
>**Stu:** To begin with, we may just ignore his actions in the dreamworld. I wanna trick the player into thinking its just a mini-game, but in such a way that when we reveal the truth, it doesn't seem like a trick :P maybe to begin with we can just add minor damage to the city, cos he's not found any people to kill, but later on some hapless people get in the way? 
>**Pete:** I see. So the night sweats seem just another part of his character? Making him somewhat nervous could be interesting as well - then the change between that and his ravenous alter ego more pronounced.

>**Pete:** Is there a big thing being planned by the people who run the city, are you a part of it? Conspiracys and cults etc... perhaps a serious of running murders that push the story along? Ritualistic etc...

>**Pete:** Possibly a choice between the gutter and the aristocracy? Helping poorer people could help give information, but means you are less privy to more private and rich circles (and so maybe upgrades etc...?) 
>**Stu:** I'm wary of going down an RPG route with this game, considering the size of our team, and the amount of work it takes to get RPG elements working properly. 
>**Pete:** Haha yeh that's a fair point lol. Unless it was simply if you'd done a certain mission, certain doors were locked/conversation points etc... but i have no idea how programming like that works so yeh....

We can use the classic 1st person narrative to tell our story, both within the game and as a transition between game states.

>**Pete:** As the character's mind starts to deteriorate and the two sections of the game merge, I would like to suggest a third and final act - playing through his memories as he gets progressively younger, discovering why he suffers what he does. If possible sections should merge and flow much like memories do. This culminates in a tense section where the character as a six year old is chased throughout a very early memory without a weapons by the fully fledged monster. This could be a very tense way to end the game.

>**Pete:** I would like to suggest multiple ending depending on what choices the character made, and what he read /discovered in the last section. Is he incurably insane, racked with grief or trapped in limbo?

>**Stu:** These are the big questions that will define and develop the storyline. Honestly, I don't know why the character is like this yet, I just thought of the concept. I like the Dark City idea that someone/thing else is altering the world. We would need to create the conspiracy, and we could also use that for a number of the earlier and side missions.

>**Stu:** I also like your flashback idea, unfortunately it wouldn't mesh to well with the external manipulation concept, but the fact that we have multiple good choices is no bad idea, and maybe we can add them all into a divergent ending strategy. 
>**Pete:** As far as it goes - it could be that its been planned for years by some outside force - something that occurred early in childhood and then pops up throughout. Mainly I just like the idea of running through his past, getting progressively smaller so the end section is a lot more nerve racking! Multiple endings wouldn't be too awful to work out either - certain objects found could trigger it, or moral actions taken
