## Money
Money can be amassed by completing objectives, (selling assets?, ?). You need money to use assets on objectives.
## Objectives
Objectives name a number of tasks that need to be completed before the objective can be declared complete. Any player with the required asset and funds can complete a task, placing a stakeholder token on the objective's task.
When an objective is completed, rewards are split between the stakeholders, and the objective goes into the accomplishments stack.
