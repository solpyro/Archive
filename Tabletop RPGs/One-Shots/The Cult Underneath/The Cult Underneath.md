## Story outline
Our story opens in [[The Four Horsemen]].
The players have responded to an open request for ‘brave souls’, and are generally unknown to each other.
>Have the players arrive and introduce themselves.

Eventually, [[NPC1]] arrives and introduces themselves. [[NPC1]] posted the request, and explains the quest:
- Group to travel with [[NPC1]] to [[LOC2]] to enter the dungeon/basement ([[Basement Chapel]]) and gather information about a supposed secret cult
- Reward from [[NPC1]] on completion

Roll **CON** for drunkenness
	- Poor rolls may be hungover
	- Great rolls may be rewarded with insight

Shortly after arriving at and exploring [[LOC2]], [[NPC1]] is killed and Group battle with mooks.
- Mooks die/run away (luck?) and Group need to search [[NPC1]]’s body for clues
- Group finds [[key/map]] and gains entrance to [[Basement Chapel]]
- Also find note from [[NPC2]], showing that [[NPC1]] was ripping you off/selling you out
- Possibly find cultic totem?
	- (Cthulu Mythos > **INT**/**EDU**) Perception to uncover meaning

(Describe the change in scenery on the way to [[Basement Chapel]])
[[Basement Chapel]] gives the group their first glimpse of the basement chapel.
- 
Group stops in their tracks, fearing capture
- Group should try to stealth around to a better vantage point (Stealth > **DEX**)
- Could go in all guns blazing (Brawl/**SIZ**)
