## Overview
*Roll for Shoes* is a narrative-driven RPG, where the players are encouraged to have a go, and all tasks involve a d6 roll. Players all start with one skill: **Do Anything 1**. This means that any action they need to perform will require them to roll **1d6** and beat a contesting roll (the GMs or another player’s).

If a player’s roll comes up all 6’s, they earn a new skill one rank higher than, and a subset of, the skill they were using. So using **Do Anything 1** to eat some cake, and rolling a 6 would give you, say, **Teeth of Biting 2**.

Any failed rolls earn the player 1XP. Players can use an XP to push a die in a roll up to 6, so they can earn a new skill. This does not affect the value of the roll, and so can’t change the outcome of the action (a fail is still a fail). For example:

>Bob *(XP: 0, Do Anything 1)*  rolls to see if he is wearing shoes. He rolls **1d6** with a result of **3** while the GM rolls **1d6** resulting in **5**, and so tells Bob that he is wearing crocs. Bob's fail means he gains **1 XP**. 
>Bob tries to kick down a wooden door and rolls **5** on **1d6**, against the GMs **4** on **1d6**, so the door is kicked down. Bob then spends his XP to push the **5** into a 6 and earn the skill **Smashing Crocs 2**.
## Resolving an action
Say what you do and roll the number of **d6**s for the level of skill you’re using.

If the sum of your roll is higher than the opposing roll (either another player or the DM), the thing you wanted to happen, happens. Otherwise you gain **1XP**.

If you roll all sixes on your roll, you can get new skill one level higher than the one you used for the action. The skill must be a subset of what happened to you in the action.
## Getting Started

To start, all you need is a few players with character sheets for each, a decent d6 pool and an idea for how to start the game.

Each player should choose their some or all of their name, gender, age and any other starting attributes you like, but they will only have one skill: **Do Anything 1**

The GM should guide the players in developing their world and characters, and has veto powers on any new skills that aren’t related to what the player was doing.
## Combat
No real consequences, more of a cartoony cloud fight, where PCs will dust themselves down at the end.
