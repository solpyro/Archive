## Basic Skills
| Attribute | Name | Description | Attribute | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **STR** | Strength | *Physical power* | **CON** | Constitution | *Health and hardiness*
| **POW** | Power | *Force of will, spirit, mental stability* | **DEX** | Dexterity | *Physical agility and speed*
| **APP** | Appearance | *Charm and physical appeal* | **SIZ** | Size | *Height & weight*
| **INT** | Intelligence | *Cunning, logic & intuition* | **EDU** | Education | *Knowledge & learning*
## Luck
Used to see if the environment is on a players side (ie. is there a weapon nearby?, does this flashlight have power?, when I hit the jukebox, does it start playing)
- Roll <= current luck value  
- For ‘Group Luck’ least lucky person rolls
## Sanity
Mythos or ‘mundane’ horrors require a sanity check. Sanity loss is described as LESSER/GREATER (ie. 0/1D6, 2/1D10). Passing (<= current Sanity) means you lose the LESSER amount, while failing will make you lose the GREATER, and the GM controls your next action.

If your sanity loss >= 5, roll 1D100 against INT. If the roll is less than INT, the player goes insane for 1D10 hours, gains a phobia/mania from the GM, and will be presented with hallucinations by the GM. Player can make a ‘reality check’ against hallucinations by attempting another sanity check, but failure will make you madder. 

## Dice Rolls
| > Target | <= Target | <= Target/2 | <= Target/5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fail | Success | Hard Success | Extreme Success |

Failed (non-combat) rolls can be ‘pushed’ (re-rolled) if justified to GM, but a second failure means the GM can inflict a dire consequence. 

Bonus/Penalty dice can be awarded by GM during non-combat rolls. Roll an extra ‘tens’ D10 and use the lowest/highest ‘tens’ dice respectively.
## Combat

Players and NPCs act in order of **DEX**, highest first, and each character can take 1 significant action.

When attacked, characters can **fight back** or **dodge**. Fighting back uses your **Fight skill**, and if you win your opponent takes damage. Dodging uses **Dodge skill**, but you can't inflict damage in return. Win a combat interaction by getting a better success than your opponent.

## Damage

| Unarmed attack (human) | 1D3+Damage Bonus |
| --- | --- |
| Knife | 1D4+Damage Bonus
| Machete | 1D8+Damage Bonus
