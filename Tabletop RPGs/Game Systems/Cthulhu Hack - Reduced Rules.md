## Core Mechanics

### Dice
Requires **d20**, **d12**, **d10**, **d8**, **d6** and **d4** (between us)
### Saves - World Actions
Roll below stat on **d20** to pass.
Advantage: roll twice, player chooses
Disadvantage: roll twice, GM chooses
### Uses - Expendable Resources
This mechanic is used for attributes such as **Sanity**, **Flashlights**, **Smokes** and **Ammo**. To use the resource, you will roll the die indicated on your card, but on a roll of 1 or 2, your resource diminishes. This means next time you use the resource, you’ll have to roll a smaller die, using the progression below:

>**d20** > **d12** > **d10** > **d8** > **d6** > **d4**

On a roll of 1 or 2 on a **d4**, you are out of that resource, until you can replenish.

**Sanity** and **Ammo** should be self-explanatory, so we’ll just explain **Flashlights** and **Smokes** here. You’ll use your **Flashlight** resource whenever you're trying to investigate or discover something (logic skills). Your **Smokes** resource is for when you’re trying to get information through a social or personal connection (people skills).

### Roll Stats
Roll **3d6** to determine your **Str**ength, **Dex**terity, **Con**stitution, **Wis**dom, **Int**elligence and **Cha**risma, but note that if one of these rolls gives you a stat of *15+*, your next roll should be **2d6+2**.
### Choose a Class
Your class is important for how you’d like your character to behave in the world and roughly ranges from thuggish to intellectual. Read through the table below and decide on a class.
